Basic CLI Features
Hands-on: Try the Terraform: Get Started tutorials.

The command line interface to Terraform is the terraform command, which accepts a variety of subcommands such as terraform init or terraform plan.

We refer to the terraform command line tool as "Terraform CLI" elsewhere in the documentation. This terminology is often used to distinguish it from other components you might use in the Terraform product family, such as Terraform Cloud or the various Terraform providers, which are developed and released separately from Terraform CLI.
